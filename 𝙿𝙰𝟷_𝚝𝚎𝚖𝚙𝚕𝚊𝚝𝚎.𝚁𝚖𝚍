## Analyzing Activity Data

plot system library(lattice)

### Loading and preprocessing the data

1. Load the data (i.e. `read.csv()`)

```r
if(!file.exists('activity.csv')){
    unzip('activity.zip')
}
data <- read.csv('activity.csv')
```

### What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

1. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
```r
steps_by_day <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data, sum)
hist(steps_by_day$steps, main = paste("Total Steps Each Day"), col="blue", xlab="Number of Steps")
```
2. Calculate and report the **mean** and **median** total number of steps taken per day
```r
rmean <- mean(steps_by_day$steps)
rmedian <- median(steps_by_day$steps)
```
#The mean is 1.0766 Ã— 104 and the median is 10765.

### What is the average daily activity pattern?

1. Make a time series plot (i.e. `type = "l"`) of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)
```r
steps_by_interval <- aggregate(steps ~ interval, data, mean)

plot(steps_by_interval$interval,steps_by_interval$steps, type="l", xlab="Interval", ylab="Number of Steps",main="Average Number of Steps per Day by Interval")
```

2. Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?
```r
max_interval <- steps_by_interval[which.max(steps_by_interval$steps),1]
```
#The 5 minutes interval, on average across all the days in the data set, with the maximum number of steps is 835.

### Imputing missing values

Strategy: 
Missing values were imputed by inserting the average for each interval. Thus, if interval 10 was missing on 10-02-2012, the average for that interval for all days (0.1320755), replaced the NA.
```r
incomplete <- sum(!complete.cases(data))
imputed_data <- transform(data, steps = ifelse(is.na(data$steps), steps_by_interval$steps[match(data$interval, steps_by_interval$interval)], data$steps))
```
Zeroes were imputed for 10-01-2012 because it was the first day and would have been over 9,000 steps higher than the following day, which had only 126 steps. NA is supposed to be 0 to fit the rising trend of the data.
```r
imputed_data[as.character(imputed_data$date) == "2012-10-01", 1] <- 0
```
Recount total steps by day and create Histogram.
```r
steps_by_day_i <- aggregate(steps ~ date, imputed_data, sum)
hist(steps_by_day_i$steps, main = paste("Total Steps Each Day"), col="blue", xlab="Number of Steps")
```
Create Histogram to show difference
```r
hist(steps_by_day$steps, main = paste("Total Steps Each Day"), col="red", xlab="Number of Steps", add=T)
legend("topright", c("Imputed", "Non-imputed"), col=c("blue", "red"), lwd=10)
```
New mean and median for imputed data.
```r
rmean.i <- mean(steps_by_day_i$steps)
rmedian.i <- median(steps_by_day_i$steps)
```
Difference between imputed and non-imputed data.
```r
mean_diff <- rmean.i - rmean
med_diff <- rmedian.i - rmedian
```
Total difference.
```r
total_diff <- sum(steps_by_day_i$steps) - sum(steps_by_day$steps)
```
The new mean is 10590 
The new median is 10766 
The difference between the original and new mean is -176.4949
The difference between the original and new median is 1.1887
The difference between total number of steps between original and new data is 75363. Thus, there were 75363 more steps in the imputed data.

### Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

Make a plot

```r
weekdays <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", 
              "Friday")
imputed_data$dow = as.factor(ifelse(is.element(weekdays(as.Date(imputed_data$date)),weekdays), "Weekday", "Weekend"))

steps_by_interval_i <- aggregate(steps ~ interval + dow, imputed_data, mean)

library(lattice)

xyplot(steps_by_interval_i$steps ~ steps_by_interval_i$interval|steps_by_interval_i$dow, main="Average Steps per Day by Interval",xlab="Interval", ylab="Steps",layout=c(1,2), type="l")
```
The plot compares and contrasts number of steps between the week and weekend. There is a higher peak earlier on weekdays, and more overall activity on weekends.
